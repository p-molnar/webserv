Methods Supported: 
- GET:
    Requests data from specified resource. Used for retrieving web pages, images and other data.

- HEAD:
    Similar to GET, but it retrieves only the header of the resources.

- POST:
    Submits data to the specified resource for processing. Used to uploading files etc. 

- PUT:
    Replaces or updates the resource at the specified URL.

- DELETE:
    Deletes the specified resource. Used to remove resources from the server. 
    Like PUT, DELETE is idempotent,
    and its effect is to change the server state by removing the targeted resource.

- TRACE:
    Echoes the received request, primarily for debugging purposes.

KEY FEATURES OF HTTP/1.1:
1 - HTTP Pipelining:
    is a technique in which multiple HTTP requests are sent on a single TCP connection,
    without waiting for the corresponding responses.
        
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol TCP/IP):
        Is family of communication protocols used to connect computer systems in a network.
        It organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client.
        Guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network before it transmits data,
        TCP establishes a connection between a SOURCE and its DESTINATION.

2 - HTTP persistent connection (HTTP keep-alive):
    Is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and recieve multiple HTTP requests/responses,
    as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.

3 - Compress/Decompression (Content Encoding):
    A capability that can be built into web servers and web clients to improve transfer speed and bandwidth utilization.
