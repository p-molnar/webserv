       Response      = Status-Line             
                       *(( general-header        
                        | response-header       
                        | entity-header ) CRLF)

                       [ message-body ]          

HTTP status codes are standardized responses used by web servers to indicate the result of a client's request.
The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:
    - 1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process
    - 2xx: Success - The action was successfully received,
    understood, and accepted
    - 3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to
    complete the request
    - 4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot
    be fulfilled
    - 5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently
    valid request

- 2xx SUCCES

    - 200 OK:
